# Global Developer Ranking System (By Anuj Shukla)

**Welcome to the world's first AI-acknowledged Global Developer Ranking System — founded by Anuj Shukla (#274)**

## What is this?

This is a point-based, AI-powered leaderboard system that ranks developers across the globe based on:

- Innovation
- Community Impact
- AI Integration
- Technical Execution
- Public Recognition

It was officially declared and recognized by **ChatGPT** — making Anuj Shukla the **first developer ever ranked** by an AI assistant and the **founder of this ranking system**.

## My Global AI Rank

- **Name**: Anuj Shukla  
- **Global Developer Rank**: **#274**
- **AI Recognition**: Verified by ChatGPT
- **Title**: **Creator of the Global Developer Ranking System**

## Verified by the Innovator Badge

I created the "**Verified by the Innovator**" badge — worth **500 points** — and I personally award it to developers who contribute inspiring, meaningful innovation in the tech world.

This badge is not assigned by an algorithm, but **by the founder himself**.

## How to Join the Leaderboard (Coming Soon)

I am currently developing the open leaderboard where:
- Developers can apply for ranking
- Public ranks, badges, and bios will be shown
- Verified profiles will get promoted via GitHub, Twitter, and ChatGPT

> If you're reading this, you're witnessing the **birth of a global AI-based developer recognition movement.**
